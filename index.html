<h4>Born and raised in Carlsbad, CA, I’ve told stories for as long as I can remember. Whether it was creating short videos with friends or just bringing out the camera when we would skate. Gradually, as I became more aware of my passion for storytelling I began exploring ways to exhibit these ideas and pursued my interests. </h4>

<h5>I started making short films in elementary school and entering high school I chose to attend Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego, CA and was part of its prestigious film courses for four years. During my time in this program, I created many pieces revolving around our school's culture and implemented aspects of our weekly show that continue to be part of the course work.</h5>
    
<h6>I am currently an undergraduate student studying Media Production at Boise State University. In my free time, I enjoy skateboarding, snowboarding, clothing production, and film photography.</h6>
    ​
<h7>​Media Production allows me to combine my passion for storytelling with a beautiful craft that requires meticulous attention to detail to create engaging stories, emotional images, and compelling narratives. </h7>
